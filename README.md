# JUCE_helloSampler
This is a plugin that functions as a basic sampler. The user can load it into any DAW, drag and drop an audio file into it and then play that file at various pitches using the MIDI keyboard. It also includes ADSR functionality allowing the user to change various parameters. More functionality coming soon!
